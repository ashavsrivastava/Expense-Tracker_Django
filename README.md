The Aim of this project is to make a Web Application that performs operations that help individuals manage their finances. We have simulated possible operations such as logging of expenditures and incomes, graphing transactions over time periods, and using Machine Learning algorithms to predict future finances. All data is stored in tables inside a database that is accessed and used with the help of Djangoâ€™s MVT architecture. The Application is locally hosted and coded primarily with the help of Python libraries.
